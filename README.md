# ld53 - Stork 17

Play as a Stork Deliveryman as he shoots his way through a criminal organisation invading the White Birdhouse with his akimbo pistols while trying to deliver the President's Baby to him.

Controls:
LMB / RMB: Shoot (You have two guns, LMB fires left, RMB fires right)
A / D: Move left and right
R: HOLD to reload. While reloading, you cannot move or shoot at all. Completing a reload only reloads the emptier pistol
Space: Jump or fly midair

You lose if you get hit just once, so be careful. Note you can only quit by pressing ESC when dead.
